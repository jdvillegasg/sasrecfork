# Amazon reviews

The datasets have been taken from [Amazon Reviews Datasets Github](https://amazon-reviews-2023.github.io/) and
there is a copy of them also at [Amazon Reviews Datasets UCSD](https://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/).

!!! success "Note on the forked repo"
    The datasets names used by the original repo are slighthly different, suggesting that either the datasets used on training are different or the datasets themselve have changed.
